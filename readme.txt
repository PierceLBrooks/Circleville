Circleville - Ludum Dare 50

A puzzle game that asks you to iteratively solve for distance sum inequalities
given multiple focus points in a space using an intentionally unintuitive variable/parameter tuning interface.
If you accidentally move your temporary solution point outside of an increasingly shrinking circular area which
encapsulates the problem domain, then you lose! Solving one round restores the borders of that area by an incremental
radius bonus proportional to how much time you took, and the equations gain more focus points to become more complex
as more equations are solved, so you will lose eventually!
